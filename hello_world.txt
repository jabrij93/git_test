Few weeks after quitting my job and make my 2nd attempt on programming,24/5/2022, doubt creeps in. 
The job where I work before, has made me questioned my abilities, has somehow plant the seed of doubt that I am not good enough. 
Even the slightest thought will affect our self-esteem. And for the most part, it effects is major. Find a way to remove that seed so you thrive. So you live a
more meaningful and fun life.
